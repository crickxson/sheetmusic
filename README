## Weird features
Darker text produces louder notes.

## Slurred and tied notes
Sheetmusic produces pure sounds; within a spreadsheet cell,
there is no variation in pitch or dynamic. Thus, the concept
of slurred and tied notes is unnecessary. That is, two tied
or slurred notes sound the same as two not-slurred notes.

(add examples with normal sheet music)

You can create an effect like slurred and tied notes by
breaking your song into more rows and introducing variation.
For example, break your song into thirty-second notes instead
of quarter notes, and make the first thirty-second note a bit
louder; this will be like you're pressing down on a piano key
anew rather than holding it down.

## Glissando
Create a glissando effect by drawing a border around the cells
of interest. Pitches are interpolated between any cells that
contain notes, and empty cells in the region are ignored.
