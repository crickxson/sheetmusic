(data table slide)

The [data table](http://www.datakind.org/blog/whats-in-a-table/)
is an intuitive paradigm for many people. In a data table, rows
correspond to observations/records, and columns to variables/attributes
collected about each observation/record.

(data table in a spreadsheet slide)

We can use spreadsheets to represent data tables, and we can use
data tables to represent musical scores.

(spreadsheet versus ordinary sheet music slide)

In this figure we see music represented in two forms.

(spreadsheet versus ordinary sheet music slide, with column/staff highlighted)

Each column in the spreadsheet corresponds to a staff in the sheet music,

(spreadsheet versus ordinary sheet music slide, with row/beat highlighted)

and each row in the spreadsheet corresponds to a beat.

(spreadsheet versus ordinary sheet music slide, with styles for dynamics)

We can use color to represent dynamics (how loud or soft the sound is).

(spreadsheet versus ordinary sheet music slide, with borders for bars)

Music is often divided into measures. In sheet music, this is typically
represented with bars, and we can do the same in spreadsheets.

(Slide: ddpy.to_midi(df), with a diagram of all of the translations)

Spreadsheets store data, so we can use them just as we can use any data
table format.

(Slide: synthesizer functions)

Spreadsheets are also code, so we can use them to make music.
I wrote a package that lets you use a spreadsheet as a music synthesizer.

("pip2 install sheetmusic")

To be confusing, let's call it "SheetMusic".

% Explain, functions, examples

I find that people are overly constrained in their perception of what
different software tools can do.

> **Relational databases: PostgreSQL, SQL Server, MySQL, SQLite

In particular, people think of things
like spreadsheets as specialized data analysis software even though they
function as generalized application programming languages.

(csvsoundsystem picture)

My colleagues at csv soundsystem and I have written music synthesizers
for several data analysis programs.

The basic paradigm is to represent musical scores in data structures that
are designed for storing data tables.

(ddr slide)

In R, this is the `data.frame`.

(ddpy slide)

In pandas (Python), this is the `DataFrame`.

(quote the reddit comment about how we're economists who don't know anything else)

Here's what someone on reddit had to say about one of our music videos.
I like to represent music as data tables because I'm very used to thinking
about data tables, but it turns out that other nice things happen when we
use data analysis software to make music.

(slide with fms symphony)

The most obvious thing is that it lets us make music from empirical data.
Here's a music video about the finances of the United States government.
(Explain what's in the video.)

We wrote this music video in R.

(slide with a stereotypical picture: What isn't data analysis?)

When we start using data analysis software for other things,
we also blur the line between data analysis and other things.
Data analysis seems very magical to many people. When we represent
data as familiar things like music, the analysis becomes more
accessible.

% slide with abstract data versus concrete stuff

Numbers are abstract, theoretical things that don't have to be
related to the world.

% slide with conversions between data

When I say that data things are "magical" to people, I mean that
people don't recognize that we can convert between these abstract
numbers and this real world. When I explain the conversion in
excruciating detail, it makes perfect sense to people.

% 

If I say that the computer is going to (do something) and
figure out (something), it can sound like the computer is doing
something very fancy that you couldn't possibly understand.
But if I say that the computer is..., it's almost kind of boring and obvious.

% a fancy-looking plot

The same goes for conversions in the other direction. This plot
might look very fancy, but we can decompose it...

% Grammar of graphics slide

The Grammar of Graphics..., non-visual aesthetics

By making data more tangible, we make them less scary and more easy to understand.









## Weird features
Darker text produces louder notes.

## Bars
If you set the time signature (meter), there will be as many
notes in a bar as the first number, and each note will be the
length specified by the (inverse of the) second number.

If you set no time signature, horizontal borders will be used
as the breaks between bars.

You can also set just the second number of the meter
to indicate the length of a cell; if you don't set it,
the default of 4 (quarter note) will be used.

## Slurred and tied notes
Sheetmusic produces pure sounds; within a spreadsheet cell,
there is no variation in pitch or dynamic. Thus, the concept
of slurred and tied notes is unnecessary. That is, two tied
or slurred notes sound the same as two not-slurred notes.

(add examples with normal sheet music)

You can create an effect like slurred and tied notes by
breaking your song into more rows and introducing variation.
For example, break your song into thirty-second notes instead
of quarter notes, and make the first thirty-second note a bit
louder; this will be like you're pressing down on a piano key
anew rather than holding it down.

## Glissando
Create a glissando effect by setting the cells of interest to the
same background color. Pitches are interpolated between any cells
that contain notes, and empty cells in the region are ignored.

This requires Python 2 because mingus requires Python 2.

## Installing
Install lilypond, fluidsynth, gnumeric, maybe something else. Then

    make install

## To do

* Separate stuff into a separate package that doesn't depend on Gnumeric;
    this way, it'll be easier to test.
* Mock the Gnumeric module for testing and whatnot
* Anonymous functions `call(string_function, *args)`
* `=play`, `=loop`, `=sheetmusic`
